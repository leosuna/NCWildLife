                Here at NC Wild Life Rehab we live on donations.  We are not federally or state supported (supplies or
                monetary), all of our operations are funded from either our pockets or from the grace of our courageous good
                samaritans.  Looking towards the future, our ever expanding needs can sometimes seem overwhelming, with your
                help the task seems a little less daunting.  Even the simplest of gift can often change the success rate of
                our precious little friends.

                Through calendar year 2017 we have seen well over 500 animals come through our doors.  Many of these sweet babies are
                rehabilitated and released into the wild sucessfully!  While we strive to release and return to natural habitat
                quickly, there are some that require additional time before they are ready.  In a few cases the animal is unable to
                be released and will live their lives here at our facility or are transferred to a long term care partner to
                live happily ever after.  As you can imagine this increases the bordon to our supplies and time.

                This is where you come in, NC Wild Life Rehab is looking to you for help reaching our goals!  Through donations:
                time, supplies, or monetary we look to continuously build our rehab, expanding for whatever may be brought through
                our doors.  Every little bit helps: cleaning, feeding, building, lumber, wire, or cash we use to build a safe
                place for our furry friends to recuperate or mature ultimately going back out to where they want to be.  For
                those that stay with us, to forever shower us with their love, your donation keeps food in their bellies, safe
                housing away from predators, and someone to watch over their every need!
